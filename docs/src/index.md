This package allows one to estimate the transfer entropy between event-based time series
(such as spike trains or social media post times) in continuous time (that is, without discretising
time into bins).

It contains implementations of the estimator and local permutation scheme presented in
[Estimating Transfer Entropy in Continuous Time Between Neural Spike Trains or Other
Event-Based Data](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.154377).
